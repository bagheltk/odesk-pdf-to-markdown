Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand has for some time now been experiencing something of a ‘golden age‘. The richness of Australasia‘s philosophical past, though less well known, should also not be forgotten. Australasian philosophy, although heavily indebted to overseas trends, includes much distinctive and highly original work. The Companion contains a wide range of articles contributed by prominent philosophers and scholars, and includes biographical essays on selected philosophers, topics and controversies, as well as shorter entries on associations, research centres, departments, journals, pedagogy, and international links. Important philosophical contributions made by those working outside of the academy are also included, along with philosophy‘s recent inroads into the wider community – in primary and secondary schools, community based forums and ‘philosophy cafés‘.

A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand will provide scholars and the wider community, in Australia, New Zealand and beyond, with a greater appreciation of the philosophical heritage of this region, and will be a standard work of reference for many years to come. “Oppy and Trakakis‘ judicious and authoritative Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand plumbs the depths, revealing much that will be news even to Australasian readers. This magnificent achievement outshines even Selwyn Grave‘s loving 1984 A History of Philosophy in Australia.”
